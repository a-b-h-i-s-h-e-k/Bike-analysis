# Bike Rental Analysis

# Overview
- This Jupyter Notebook focuses on analyzing bike rental data to uncover trends, patterns, and factors influencing bike rentals. The notebook explores data cleaning, visualization, and statistical modeling to derive meaningful insights.

# Features
1.Data Preprocessing:
- Handles missing values, duplicates, and inconsistent data.
- Converts date/time fields for temporal analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
- Visualizes bike rental trends by time (hourly, daily, and seasonal).
- Analyzes relationships between weather conditions and bike rentals.
- Identifies key variables influencing bike demand.

3. Statistical Modeling:
- Applies regression models to predict bike rental demand.
- Evaluates the impact of environmental and temporal factors.

4. Visualizations:
- Time series plots for rental trends.
- Heatmaps to show correlations between variables.
- Bar and scatter plots for categorical and numerical relationships.

# Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
